# Microservices Principles

Microservices architecture requires certain key principles to ensure scalability, resilience, and efficiency. Below are some essential principles for building robust microservices systems:

## 1. Zero-Configuration
Any microservices system will likely have hundreds of services. Manually configuring IP addresses, ports, and API capabilities is infeasible. The system should be designed to automatically handle these configurations.

## 2. Highly-Redundant
Service failures are common in microservices. To mitigate this, the system should have redundancy with failover mechanisms in place, ensuring minimal downtime and availability of duplicate services.

## 3. Fault-Tolerant
The system should be resilient to errors, miscommunication, and timeouts. Even if certain services are down, the rest of the system should continue functioning without major disruptions.

## 4. Self-Healing
Failures and outages are inevitable. The system should be able to detect failures and automatically recover lost services and functionalities to maintain reliability.

## 5. Auto-Discovery
New services should be automatically identified and integrated into the system without requiring manual intervention. This allows seamless scaling and addition of new features.

By following these principles, a microservices-based system can achieve high availability, scalability, and maintainability. ðŸš€
